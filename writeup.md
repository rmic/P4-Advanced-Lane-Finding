## Udacity P4 : **Advanced Lane Finding Project**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.
* Apply a distortion correction to raw images.
* Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.
* Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view").
* Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.
* Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
* Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.
* Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.

## [Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/571/view) Points

### Here I will consider the rubric points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.

---

### Writeup / README

#### 1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one.

This is it!

### Camera Calibration

#### 1. Briefly state how you computed the camera matrix and distortion coefficients. Provide an example of a distortion corrected calibration image.

I defined a function named `distortion`, which returns the matrix and distortion coefficients. It iterates over the provided calibration images, looks for the corners using the `findObjPoints` function (which basically calls `findChessboardCorners` from OpenCV). The corners are stored in a list of object points, which is then provided to `calibrateCamera` to compute the matrix and distortion coefficients.

```python

def findObjPoints(img):
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    ret, corners = cv2.findChessboardCorners(gray, (nx,ny), None)
    return ret, corners

def distortion(im):
    objp = np.zeros((ny * nx, 3), np.float32)
    objp[:, :2] = np.mgrid[0:nx, 0:ny].T.reshape(-1, 2)

    # Arrays to store object points and image points from all the images.
    objpoints = []
    imgpoints = []

    # Make a list of calibration images
    images = glob.glob('camera_cal/calibration*.jpg')
    # Step through the list and search for chessboard corners
    for idx, fname in enumerate(images):
        img = cv2.imread(fname)

        # Find the chessboard corners
        ret, corners = findObjPoints(img)

        # If found, add object points, image points
        if ret == True:
            objpoints.append(objp)
            imgpoints.append(corners)


    ret, mtx, dist, rvecs, tvecs = cv2.calibrateCamera(objpoints, imgpoints, (im.shape[1], im.shape[0]), None, None)
    return mtx, dist
```

### Pipeline (single images)

#### 1. Provide an example of a distortion-corrected image.

To demonstrate this step, I will describe how I apply the distortion correction to one of the test images like this one:
![Distortion][undistort2]

#### 2. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you used color transforms, gradients or other methods to create a thresholded binary image.  Provide an example of a binary image result.

I used a combination of color and a sobel filter (kernel size : 5), with thresholds to generate a binary image. The following block shows the code used to achieve this. The `sobel`, `hls_select` functions are wrapper around the corresponding OpenCV functions. The `combine` function keeps the pixels that are matched by both filters.

```python
    sobx = sobel(undistorted, 5, 'x', thresh=(20, 90))
    hls = hls_select(undistorted, 2, (180, 255))

    binary = combine(sobx, hls)
    binary = apply_lane_mask(binary, l_cut=.45, r_cut=.55, b_cut=.95, t_cut=.6, br_cut=.87, bl_cut=.10)
```

Here is an example of a binary image as generated by these filters.
![Binary][binary]


#### 3. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you performed a perspective transform and provide an example of a transformed image.

The code that actually performs the perspective transform stands in one single function named `warp`, which generates the perspective transformation matrix and calls the warpPerspective function from OpenCV.


```python
def warp(img, src, dst):
    M = cv2.getPerspectiveTransform(src, dst)
    return cv2.warpPerspective(img, M, (img.shape[1], img.shape[0]), flags=cv2.INTER_LINEAR)
```

The source and destination points used were identified on a test image with straight lines and were defined as follows:

src= np.float32([[241,684],[594,450],[686,450],[1061,684]])
dst= np.float32([[500,720],[500,0],[800,0],[800,720]])
This resulted in the following source and destination points:

| Source        | Destination   |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| 241, 684      | 500, 720      |
| 594, 450      | 500, 0        |
| 686, 450      | 800, 0        |
| 1061, 684     | 800, 720      |

I verified that my perspective transform was working as expected by drawing the `src` and `dst` points onto a test image and its warped counterpart to verify that the lines appear parallel in the warped image.

#### 4. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you identified lane-line pixels and fit their positions with a polynomial?

The line fitting is achieved using the `fit_lines` function. It applies the histogram and sliding-window technique described in the lectures. In order to achieve better results, we increased the number of windows and decreased the margin in which we look for pixels. This helped to fit the lane lines better.

The pixels are collected and a polynomial is fitted using numpy's polyfit function. 

Each time a new window is evaluated and enough pixels are found inside, the mean x position serves as the new center column for the following windows.


#### 5. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you calculated the radius of curvature of the lane and the position of the vehicle with respect to center.

This is done between lines 252 and 258 using the following code (very similar to the useful pieces of code provided in the lectures)

```python
   # Fit new polynomials to x,y in world space
    left_fit_cr = np.polyfit(lefty * ym_per_pix, leftx * xm_per_pix, 2)
    right_fit_cr = np.polyfit(righty * ym_per_pix, rightx * xm_per_pix, 2)
    # Calculate the new radii of curvature
    left_curverad = ((1 + (2 * left_fit_cr[0] * y_eval * ym_per_pix + left_fit_cr[1]) ** 2) ** 1.5) / np.absolute(
        2 * left_fit_cr[0])
    right_curverad = ((1 + (2 * right_fit_cr[0] * y_eval * ym_per_pix + right_fit_cr[1]) ** 2) ** 1.5) / np.absolute(
        2 * right_fit_cr[0])
 
```

#### 6. Provide an example image of your result plotted back down onto the road such that the lane area is identified clearly.

I implemented this step in lines 329 through 343 in my code.
```python
warp_zero = np.zeros_like(warped_binary).astype(np.uint8)
    color_warp = np.dstack((warp_zero, warp_zero, warp_zero))

    # Recast the x and y points into usable format for cv2.fillPoly()
    pts_left = np.array([np.transpose(np.vstack([left_fitx, ploty]))])
    pts_right = np.array([np.flipud(np.transpose(np.vstack([right_fitx, ploty])))])
    pts = np.hstack((pts_left, pts_right))

    # Draw the lane onto the warped blank image
    cv2.fillPoly(color_warp, np.int_([pts]), (0, 255, 0))

    # Warp the blank back to original image space using inverse perspective matrix (Minv)
    newwarp = warp(color_warp, dst, src)
    # Combine the result with the original image
    result = cv2.addWeighted(undistorted, 1, newwarp, 0.3, 0)
```
  Here is an example of my result on a test image:

### Pipeline (video)

#### 1. Provide a link to your final video output.  Your pipeline should perform reasonably well on the entire project video (wobbly lines are ok but no catastrophic failures that would cause the car to drive off the road!).

Here's a [link to my video result](./output.mp4)

---

### Discussion

#### 1. Briefly discuss any problems / issues you faced in your implementation of this project.  Where will your pipeline likely fail?  What could you do to make it more robust?

The lane detection works well on the project video but fails on the challenge video, especially when a lane is made of several different textures separated by a line more or less parallel to the lane lines. 
I could have made this more robust with a little more time, by looking for two peaks separated by a distance close to that expected between lane lines and discarding other peaks that fall between or outside the suspected good ones.

The detection could also be improved by tweaking the generation of the binary image, by using more elaborate filters, and reusing information from previous frames a little more effectively.
